Sort Colors (0s, 1s, 2s)

bruteforce - inbuilt dn se sort karlo

1st method - 

cause only 3 elements hai unko store karlo with keyvalue using map ya bas variable a,b and c main aur aur loop run karo 
0 to a => printing 0s
a to b => printing 1s
b to c => printing 2s

2nd Method - Dutch National flag algorithm. 

3 pointers lo - low,mid aur high
array ke => 0 to low-1 main aaega 0s                                 Initially,puri list hi unsorted hai so wo mid se high-1 main aaegi
            low to mid-1 main aaega 1s                               i.e. low = 0, mid = 0 and high = N-1
            mid to high-1 is unsorted list                               3 conditions ->   while(low<=high)
            high to N is 2's                                                     i. if arr[mid] == 0, swap(arr[low],arr[high]) and low++,mid++                         
                                                                                 ii. if arr[mid] == 1, mid++  
                                                                                 iii. if[mid] == 2, swap(arr[mid],arr[high]) and high--.
void sortArray(vector<int>& arr, int n) {
    int low = 0, mid = 0, high = n - 1; // 3 pointers                           
    while (mid <= high) {        
        if (arr[mid] == 0) {
            swap(arr[low], arr[mid]);
            low++;
            mid++;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
            mid++;
        }
        else {
            swap(arr[mid], arr[high]);
            high--;
        }
    }
}
